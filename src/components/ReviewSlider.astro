  { name: "Teneisha Towe", review: "This vendor was so easy to use!  He came to set up the booth and returned to take it down without me and my friends having to figure anything out.  The booth had some fun features and was very user friendly.  Plus, when I chose to have my pictures sent to my cell phone, I received them within 15 mins!  That was a bonus for me because I've used other vendors and had to wait over 48hrs to receive my pictures.  I can't wait to use this vendor again!", rating: 5 },
