He was very accommodating and welcomed any and all customizations for our Photo Booth. You NEED PopStar Photobooths at your next event!!!", rating: 5 },
  { name: "Caitlyn Chason", review: "Danny was great to work with and very patient! Everyone at our event enjoyed the photobooth so much. We are looking forward to another event with him tomorrow!", rating: 5 },
  { name: "Teneisha Towe", review: "This vendor was so easy to use!  He came to set up the booth and returned to take it down without me and my fitness having to figure anything out.  The booth had some fun features and very very user friendly.  Plus, when I chose to have my pictures sent to my cell phone, I received them within 15 mins!  That was a bonus for me because I've used other vendors and had to wait over 48hrs to receive my pictures.  I can't wait to use this vendor again!", rating: 5 },

Everyone LOVED the photo booth, and it really was just what the event needed! I am so grateful for every step of the journey and what a blessing working with Danny and having Popstar there was!", rating: 5 },
